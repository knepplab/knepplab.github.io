### Zachary J. Knepp, Ph.D.
Dr. Knepp is a computational chemist and assistant professor of chemistry at Alfred University, where he teaches physical chemistry, general chemistry, and advanced laboratory courses. He earned his B.S. from Lock Haven University in 2020 and his Ph.D. from Lehigh University in 2025, with a dissertation focused on modeling excited states and charge transport using density functional theory (DFT). His research interests center on using _ab initio_ electronic structure methods to model photophysics, photochemistry, and materials.
