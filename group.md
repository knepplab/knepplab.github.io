### Zachary J. Knepp, Ph.D.
Dr. Knepp is a computational chemist and assistant professor of chemistry at Alfred University, where he teaches physical chemistry, general chemistry, and advanced laboratory courses. He earned his B.S. from Lock Haven University in 2020 and his Ph.D. from Lehigh University in 2025, with a dissertation focused on modeling excited states and charge transport using density functional theory (DFT). His research interests center on using _ab initio_ electronic structure methods to model photophysics, photochemistry, and materials.

### Katie Seamens
Alfred Chemistry Major & Materials Science and Engineering Minor 28'

Katie is a student at Alfred University whose academic focus spans chemistry, materials science, and astronomy. She is particularly drawn to understanding materials at the atomic level through computational modeling. Her current research involves modeling glassy materials to investigate conductivity relevant to solid-state battery applications. Looking ahead, she plans to pursue computational work in astrochemistry, with an emphasis on molecular formation, destruction, and interactions in space within interstellar clouds, stars, and planetary atmospheres, and on linking these fundamental processes to real-world material and chemical design. Outside of academics, her extracurricular activities include lampworking, hiking, stargazing, reading, and drawing.

### Johnson Jasson
Alfred Electrical Engineering Major 29'

Johnson is an international student from Tanzania currently studying at Alfred University, where his academic interests lie at the intersection of engineering and research. His interests span engineering, technology, and business, with a strong focus on semiconductor science. He leverages scientific inquiry that drives a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms, focusing not just on outcomes, but on the fundamental why behind phenomena. He values collaboration, continuous growth, and systematic problem-solving. His research investigates organic semiconductors by examining how temperature (T) influences electronic coupling (V) using the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), with the goal of understanding their potential applications in electronic devices.

### Holly Lyimo
Alfred Mechanical Engineering Major 29'

Holly is an international student from Tanzania at Alfred University who is deeply curious about how people, systems, and ideas grow, especially in environments where learning happens through collaboration and experimentation. She values inclusive spaces, meaningful mentorship, and opportunities that challenge her to think beyond what she already knows. She is interested in research that connects materials, engineering, and design with real-world impact. She is especially drawn to interdisciplinary work, sustainability, and projects that consider both technical innovation and human experience.
