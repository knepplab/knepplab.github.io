### Zachary J. Knepp, Ph.D.
Dr. Knepp is a computational chemist and assistant professor of chemistry at Alfred University, where he teaches physical chemistry, general chemistry, and advanced laboratory courses. He earned his B.S. from Lock Haven University in 2020 and his Ph.D. from Lehigh University in 2025, with a dissertation focused on modeling excited states and charge transport using density functional theory (DFT). His research interests center on using _ab initio_ electronic structure methods to model photophysics, photochemistry, and materials.

### Holly Lyimo
Alfred Mechanical Engineering Major 29'
Holly is a freshman international student (from Tanzania) at Alfred University who is deeply curious about how people, systems, and ideas grow, especially in environments where learning happens through collaboration and experimentation. She values inclusive spaces, meaningful mentorship, and opportunities that challenge her to think beyond what she already knows. She is interested in research that connects materials, engineering, and design with real-world impact. She is especially drawn to interdisciplinary work, sustainability, and projects that consider both technical innovation and human experience.
