### Computational Hardware
All simulations and electronic structure calculations are performed on a Thelio Major Custom workstation from System76, equipped with a 64-core (128-thread) AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7980X processor, 256 GB of DDR5 memory, and 12 TB of high-speed SSD storage (4 TB OS + 8 TB data). The system also includes an 8 GB AMD Radeon RX 7600 GPU, supporting both graphical workloads and limited GPU-accelerated computations.

### WebMO
WebMO provides a user-friendly web interface for running advanced computational chemistry software, making powerful tools accessible to students and non-specialists directly through their browser. Please see Prof. Knepp for login instructions.

### ORCA
ORCA is a versatile and widely used quantum chemistry software package developed by the group of Prof. Frank Neese. It is freely available for academic use, with commercial licensing managed through FACCTs.
