# Photoswitches

#### Rational Design and Exploration of Imine-based Photoswitches
Molecular photoswitches, by definition, undergo changes in their geometric structure and chemical properties when excited
by ultraviolet and visible light. A well-known biological example of a photoswitch, Rhodopsin, is a critical photosensor
in vertebrate vision.5 Rhodopsin is a 11-cis-retinal and opsin protein complex found in the rods cell of the retina. When
excited by particular colors of light, 11-cis-retinal undegoes cisâ†’trans photoisomerization, which induces a conformational
change in the opsin protein and initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to light perception in the brain.5 Beyond
their role in vision, molecular photoswitches have found many applications in fields such as fluorescence bioimaging, solar
energy storage, and optical data storage.4,6 Among them, azobenzenes (R-N=N-R, azos) are the most studied because of
their vibrant colors, synthetic versatility, and well-understood photoisomerization and thermal reversion mechanisms.
Azos are used in a wide range of applications, from traditional food and clothing dyes to more modern technologies such
as photopharmaceuticals (e.g. vision restoration, cancer treatment, antibacterial resistance) and molecular solar thermal
fuels.
Beyond azos, atypical photoswitches including heteroaryl imines (Figure 1c) and iminothioindoxyls (Figure 1d) are
severly understudied but have the potential to expand the capacity of photopharmacology, in particular, by adding new
routes for 'x-extension' or 'x-logization', where 'x' is a switch of interest. Imine-based photoswitches are synthetically accessible because they can be synthesized through a straightforward condensation reaction
between a primary amine and an aldehyde or ketone. Iminothioindoxyls can be synthesized in a similar fashion through a
condensation reaction with thioindoxyl and a nitrosobenzene. The amine and carbonyl precursors can be largely modified
to selectively tune the properties of the final imine products. An interesting properties of these systems is that both the E
and Z isomers adopt a non-planar (more globular) geometric structure, at least for simple derivatives. This differs from
azobenzenes whose E-isomer is usually planar and whose Z-isomer is globular.8 Through the addition of intramolecular
hydrogen bonding moieties, it should be possible to switch between globular and planar geometries through computation-
ally guided synthetic tuning. My group will use electronic structure calculations to design and rationalize the photophysical
properties and geometries of atypical imine- and iminothioindoxyl-based photoswitches.
