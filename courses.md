## CHEM 340 - Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy
---
Fundamentals of quantum mechanics applied to chemical systems, atomic and molecular structure, computational chemistry, and spectroscopy. Offered every year. Prerequisites: CHEM 106, MATH 152, PHYS 112 or 126. 3.000 Credit hours.

---
## CHEM 341 - Physical Chemistry Laboratory
---
Explores concepts in thermodynamics, kinetics, and quantum mechanics through six team-based experiments in a simulated research environment. 1.000 Credit hours.

---
## CHEM 342 - Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics
---
Foundations and applications of classical and statistical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, and molecular dynamics. 4.000 Credit hours.

---
## CHEM 400 - Advanced Chemistry Topics: Computational Chemistry
---
A hands-on introduction to modern computational chemistry. Students perform electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to explore molecular structure, properties, and reactivity. The course emphasizes practical applications, result interpretation, and computational workflows. Topics include molecular mechanics (MM), Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT), post-HF methods, and molecular dynamics (MD). Prior physical chemistry knowledge is recommended but not required. Prerequisites: CHEM 106, MATH 152. 3.000 Credit hours.
